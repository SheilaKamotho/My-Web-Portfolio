    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I am a student of Radiography at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and passionate about Medical Imaging.Since this is a technology-laden field that keeps evolving by the day, I decided to complement my biology-loaded syllabi with some tech-skills.I believe knowing the best of both worlds will help me solve real world problems in medical imaging.There was no better place to earn the tech-skills I required other than Moringa School due its reputation in graduating world class tech-professionals.</p>
